# opengl_template_project
C++ OpenGL template project


### Some things to note
- When using OpenGL and trying to render some shaders, this project will show how to setup OpenGL/glad while first starting with the initialization.
- Rule of thumb when implementing a renderer for the first time is making sure that everything in OpenGL/GLFW/glad have been setup during the initialization phase.
